# Detecting biased language from Wikipedia revisions
## Description
This repository contains the final project from Victor Garcia & Kolja Hey. This is a research in colaboration with BIGDAMA (Big Data Group from TUBerlin) .
The project consists of 2 parts: First, we extract the data from the Wikipedia dump files and second, we implement various text classification models like RNN, RCNN, Self-Attention and BERT.
This last model is the only one which has been implemented using Google colab (.ipynb file).

Text Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Natural Language Processing. In this repository, I am focussing on one such text classification task and that is Bias detection. So far I have covered following four different models in this repo.

  * RNN
  * RCNN 
  * Self-Attention
  * BERT

## Requirements
  * Python==3.6.6
  * PyTorch==0.4.0
  * torchtext==0.2.3
